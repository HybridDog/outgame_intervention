[Mod] outgame intervention [outgame_intervention]

This mod allows you to let minetest execute a .lua file which you just created.  
By default it does a file called "tmp.lua" at your worldpath, which you need to create yourself.  
You can e.g. kick this player called "admin":
* go to the folder of the world which is used
* add the tmp.lua file
* open it with a texteditor
* write minetest.kick_player("admin", "Why do you use such a name? We all know that you are not a real admin.")
* save it, e.g. by pressing ctrl+s
* be happy that it worked
